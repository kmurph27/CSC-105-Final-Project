            My name is Kyle Murphy, and I am in my last year at Concordia University Irvine. I am majoring in Computer Science there and looking to pursing work in the networking portion of my career field. I spent 5 years in the Air Force as a Network Engineer, and I am now finishing schooling so that I can pursue better career options. I was born in Southern California, but I spent most of my life in Strongsville, OH. It is about thirty minutes south of Cleveland. I am a diehard Browns fan, and we WILL make it to the Super Bowl one day (ðŸ¤žðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚). I attended Kent State University in Ohio for a few years before I joined the Air Force. I was stationed in Germany for 3 years and then 2 years in Utah. I met my wife Nicole during my time in Utah and we have now been happily married for almost 4 years now. After I got out of the military we moved back to California where we stayed in Sonora, CA for a year and now reside in San Clemente where we absolutely love it. When I manage to find some extra time, I really enjoy leatherworking, fishing, camping, and golf. Leatherworking was a hobby passed down to me from my grandpa and I still have a lot to learn, but it is extremely rewarding. Fishing is something I have enjoyed since I was little and although deep sea fishing is a blast, I am more than content sitting on the side of a lake all day. As for golf, you might think I picked it up in the Air Force but even as a kid, I just really enjoyed the game. I am still pretty bad at it, but it is just so nice to spend a sunny day at the golf course.
